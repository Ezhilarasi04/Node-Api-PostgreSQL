# Node-Api-PostgreSQL
## In-PostgreSQL
#### Created two tables named as Employee and Department
#### Basic fields of Employee as Employee_id(DB generated), Employee_name, Employee_age, Department_id(as Foreign key)
#### Basic fields of Department as Department_id(DB generated), Department_name
#### Linked Employee and Department table using Department_id
## In-Nodejs
#### Created seperate API calls for Employee table as well as for Department
#### Suported GET/PUT/POST/DELETE on the API for all Endpoints of Employees & Departments
#### Implemented seperate class and objects for Employee and Department
#### Also added Sorting functions for each fields 
## For futher informations about API calls please refer pdf file named EmployeeManagement-ouputs.pdf 
#### Where I attached respective commands and output screenshots for GET/POST/PUT/DELETE and Sorting operations
